# Password Generator in Python
Having a weak password is not good for a system that demands high confidentiality and security of user credentials. It turns out that people find it difficult to make up a strong password that is strong enough to prevent unauthorized users from memorizing it. 



## How to Install

1. Create a ```python``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/SamarthTMSL/Python-Games-and-Projects.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd Password Generator ``` 
4. Run ``` pip3 install random ```
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.
6. If the program doesn't run, run it in VS Code.


## Usage
To generate a password, run ``` python3 Password_Generator.py```
