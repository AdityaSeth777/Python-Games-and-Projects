## Time Series Graph 

<p>A time-series graph is a line plot used to visualize time series data. Time-series data is the data collected over an interval of time. Some of the popular examples of time series data are stock price data, daily sales data, daily covid cases data, etc.</p>

<p>While visualizing a time-series graph, the time intervals lie on the x-axis, and the data points collected over those time intervals lie on the y-axis. For example, while visualizing a time-series graph of stock price data, the date column will lie on the x-axis, and the price column will lie on the y-axis.</p>

<p>To visualize a time series graph using Python, I have used a stock price dataset. There are many libraries in Python for data visualization; I have used Plotly as it is easy to visualize interactive visualizations using plotly.</p>

<p>The above data is collected by using the yfinance API. Below is the visualisation of a time series graph using Python:</p>
